# Prompt for Continuing Tool Calls Investigation

## Context

There is an issue with Droid CLI's Read tool returning `[object Object],[object Object]` instead of actual image data when used with the CLI proxy. This prevents image analysis from working.

## Previous Investigation Summary

See `./docs/TOOL_CALLS_STREAMING_ISSUE.md` for full details, but key findings:

1. The issue exists on commit `8247c6c` (original code before recent changes)
2. The proxy correctly handles tool calls and SSE transformation
3. The issue is specifically in Droid's Read tool serialization
4. Something changed between when it worked and now (outside this codebase)

## Prompt for Next Session

```
Please investigate why Droid CLI's Read tool is returning [object Object],[object Object]
when reading image files through the proxy.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
- This issue also exists on commit 8247c6c, so it's NOT caused by recent proxy changes
- The proxy correctly receives and passes through tool results
- The issue is in how Droid serializes image data returned from its Read tool
- It WAS working at some point before this chat session started

YOUR INVESTIGATION SHOULD:

1. Verify the proxy's _wrap_inject_image_tool_results function is actually executing
   - Add detailed logging to track when tool result messages arrive
   - Log the tool_call_map to see if Read tool calls are being matched
   - Log when image files are successfully read and converted to data URLs

2. Trace the complete flow from tool result to proxy response
   - Check if the proxy ever sees the real image data or only [object Object]
   - Verify if the image injection function needs improvements
   - Check if tool result messages have the right structure/IDs

3. Determine if this is fixable in the proxy vs. a Droid issue
   - Can we detect when serialization fails and handle it?
   - Can we reconstruct image data from the file path?
   - Or is this fundamentally a Droid bug that can't be fixed here?

TEST CASE:
droid exec --model provider-7/claude-opus-4-1-20250805 --auto low \\
  "What do you see in this picture /mnt/c/Users/mysol/OneDrive/Pictures/Screenshots/2025-10/chrome_EaRwgA51jJ.png" \\
  --output-format debug

Expected: Image is analyzed successfully
Current: Tool result shows [object Object],[object Object]
```
